# 🔁 Assignment 06 - Loop Practice

## 📋 Description
This assignment contains **four separate loop examples** demonstrating various logical conditions using `while` loops. Each loop performs a different task involving arithmetic and conditional checks.

## 🔄 Loops Overview

### 🔢 Loop 1: Count by 5s to 55
- Increments a number by 5 starting from 0
- Prints each value until it reaches 55

### ✖️ Loop 2: Multiples of 2 and 7
- Prints numbers between 1 and 199 that are divisible by both 2 and 7 (i.e., multiples of 14)

### ➕ Loop 3: Sum of Multiples of 8
- Sums all numbers between 100 and 500 that are divisible by 8
- Displays the final sum

### 🧮 Loop 4: Sum of Odd Numbers >20 and <100
- Sums all **odd** numbers between 21 and 99
- Prints the final total

## 🛠️ How to Run
Each loop is encapsulated in its own `main()` function. Uncomment **one** loop at a time before compiling.

    gcc -o loops main.c -lm
    ./loops
